# CameraSlider

A 2-axis camera slider created to record smooth video fotage with a DSLR camera and controlled by an Arduino micro controller with C


## First Design

Built using scrap and parts available. Worked well, but needed stability improvements

## Second Design

Built using v slotted aluminum extrusions and a gantry on bearings, much more stable and better looking. Added additional stepper motor for a second axis of rotation.

## Next steps

Connect to my computer vision project and program to keep any detected objects in the center of frame while doing a smooth slide.
